2,"Interprovincial migration represents movements from one province or territory to another, involving a change in usual place of residence. A person who takes up residence in another province or territory is an out-migrant with reference to the province or territory of origin, and an in-migrant with reference to the province or territory of destination. Net interprovincial migration is the difference between the number of in-migrants and the number of out-migrants."
3,The number of interprovincial migrants is final up to 2016/2017 and preliminary for 2017/2018.
4,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (Table 17100008), international migration (Table 17100008) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100008, 17100021 and 17100022)."
5,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, estimates are based on Family Allowance data. From 1976/1977 to 2016/2017, estimates are based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. For 2017/2018, estimates are based on Canada child benefit data from CRA."
6,"From 1971/1972 to 1975/1976, estimates were based on Family Allowance data. From 1976/1977 to 1990/1991, estimates were based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. Data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from 1991/1992."
7,"From 1976/1977 to 1990/1991, in-migrants, out-migrants and net migration totals do not include migration between Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
8,"Prior to 1991/1992, only data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available. From 1991/1992 to 2016/2017, estimates were based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. For 2017/2018, estimates were based on Canada child benefit data from CRA."
9,Data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from 1991/1992.
